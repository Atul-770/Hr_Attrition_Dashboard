HR Attrition Analytics Dashboard
Overview
This project involves the development of an HR Attrition Analytics Dashboard using Power BI and SQL to analyze employee attrition trends across various factors such as age, job role, salary, and years of service. The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights for HR teams and management to optimize retention strategies and reduce turnover.

Features
Interactive Visualizations: Pie charts, bar charts, and line graphs for analyzing attrition by age, job role, salary, and tenure.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies to ensure high-quality, accurate data.
SQL Queries: Extraction and aggregation of HR data to build a solid foundation for reporting and analysis.
Actionable Insights: Identification of high attrition areas and recommendations for improving employee retention.
Tools and Technologies
Power BI: Used for creating interactive dashboards and data visualizations.
SQL: For data extraction, aggregation, and manipulation from the HR database.
Data Preprocessing: Techniques applied to clean and transform raw data.
DAX: Used in Power BI for complex calculations and creating custom measures.
